# Chances

## Notes
The original project was built in Vanilla JS, but I'm refactoring with Vue & Nuxt in an effort to learn Nuxt well enough to support an existing client project.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
